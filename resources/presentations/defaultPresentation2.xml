	The Rosetta Stone is a granodiorite stele 
	discovered in 1799 which is inscribed with three
	versions of a decreebissued in Memphis, 
	Egypt in 196 BC during the Ptolemaic 
	dynasty on behalf of King Ptolemy V Epiphanes.
	The top and middle texts are in
	Ancient Egyptian using hieroglyphic and 
	Demotic scripts respectively, while 
	the bottom is in Ancient Greek. The decree
	has only minor differences among the three
	versions, so the Rosetta Stone became key 
	to deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs, 
	thereby opening a window into ancient 
	Egyptian history.The stone was carved 
	during the Hellenistic period and is 
	believed to have originally been displayed 
	within a temple, possibly at nearby Sais.
	It was probably moved in late antiquity 
	or during the Mameluk period, and was 
	eventually used as building material 
	in the construction of Fort Julien 
	near the town of Rashid (Rosetta) in
	the Nile Delta. It was discovered 
	there in July 1799 by French soldier
	Pierre-François Bouchard during the 
	Napoleonic campaign in Egypt. It 
	was the first Ancient Egyptian bilingual 
	text recovered in modern times, and it 
	aroused widespread public interest with 
	its potential to decipher this previously 
	untranslated hieroglyphic script. Lithographic 
	copies and plaster casts beganbcirculating among
	European museums and scholars. The British
	defeated the French and took the stone to
	London under the Capitulation of Alexandria 
	in 1801. It has been on public display at 
	the British Museum almost continuously since 
	1802 and is the most visited object there.

Discovered by French soldiers during their 
occupation of Egypt on July 15, 1799, the 
Rosetta Stone is a most fortunate find. 
Weighing nearly one ton and covered in three 
columns of alternating script, the stone 
provided the key to deciphering hieroglyphics, 
the ancient Egyptian script that had puzzled 
scholars for centuries. But while many know 
its value as a translation tool, few know 
the turbulent history surrounding its 
discovery and translation—or what it actually 
says.

THE <i>MARVELLOUS</i> CORINTHIAN HELMET
		</text>
		<text font='arial' fontsize='18' fontcolor='black' xpos='5' ypos='10' starttime='100' endtime='10000'>
The Corinthian helmet originated in ancient Greece and took its name from the city-state of Corinth. 
It was a helmet made of bronze which in its later styles covered the entire head and neck, 
with slits for the eyes and mouth. A large curved projection protected the nape of the neck.
Out of combat, a Greek hoplite would wear the helmet tipped upward for comfort. 
This practice gave rise to a series of variant forms in Italy, where the slits 
were almost closed, since the helmet was no longer pulled over the face but worn 
cap-like. Although the classical Corinthian helmet fell out of use among the 
Greeks in favour of more open types, the Italo-Corinthian types remained in use 
until the 1st century AD, being used, among others, by the Roman army.

Herodotus mentions the Corinthian helmet in his Histories when writing of the Machlyes 
and Auseans, two tribes living along the River Triton in ancient Libya (the portion of 
ancient Libya he describes is most likely in modern Tunisia). The tribes chose annually 
two teams of the fairest maidens who fought each other ceremonially with sticks and stones. 
They were dressed in the finest Greek panoply topped off with a Corinthian helmet. The 
ritual fight was part of a festival honoring the virgin goddess Athena. Young women who 
succumbed to their wounds during the ordeal were thought to have been punished by the 
goddess for lying about their virginity (Histories, 4.180).

Hoa Hakananai'a is a moai 
(Easter Island statue) 
housed in the British 
Museum in London. It was 
taken from Orongo, Easter
Island (Rapa Nui) in 
November 1868 by the 
crew of the British ship 
HMS Topaze,[1] and 
arrived in England in August 
1869.[2] Though relatively
small, it is considered
to be typical of the 
island’s statue form,
[3][4] but distinguished 
by carvings added to the 
back, associated with the
island's birdman cult.[5] 
It has been described as 
a "masterpiece"[6] and 
"without a doubt, the 
finest example of Easter 
Island sculpture".

The Minoan bull leaper is a bronze group of a bull and leaper
 in the British Museum. It is the only known largely complete 
 three-dimensional sculpture depicting Minoan bull-leaping.[1]
 Although bull leaping certainly took place in Crete at this 
 time, the leap depicted is practically impossible and it has
 therefore been speculated that the sculpture may be an exaggerated 
 depiction.[1][2] This speculation has been backed up by the 
 testaments of modern-day bull leapers from France and Spain.[3]
